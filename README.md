# best-APpoll-week
This is a response to an ESPN.com article that claimed that the NCAA men's basketball week 6 AP poll is historically the most predicative of national championship, despite the week 17 being closest to the tournament. The two metrics used to bolster that claim were that all champions have been in the top 12 of the week 6 AP poll and that "the average Week 6 ranking of the eventual national champion has been 4.7". 

At the heart of this analysis lies an interesting question: "Is early season play (mostly non-conference games) undervalued when we pick our brackets?" But unfortunately the author fails to address this by computing the arthimetic mean on ordinal data. 

First, I question if the results would hold if I used the actual vote tallies and not ordinal rankings.
Second, I question if the results would hold if we looked at all tournament results and not just winners.
