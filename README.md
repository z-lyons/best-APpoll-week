# best-APpoll-week
This is a response to an ESPN.com article that claimed that the NCAA men's basketball week 6 AP poll is historically the most predicative of national championship, despite the week 17 being closest to the tournament. The two metrics used to bolster that claim were that all champions have been in the top 12 of the week 6 AP poll and that "the average Week 6 ranking of the eventual national champion has been 4.7". 

I assume the author calculated the average ranking by computing the artihmetic mean and I'd like to explore the dangers of doing that on ordinal data.
