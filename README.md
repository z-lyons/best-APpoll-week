# best-APpoll-week
This is a response to an ESPN.com article that claimed that the NCAA men's basketball week 6 AP poll is historically the most predicative of national championship, despite the fact that week 17 is the closest to the tournament. The two metrics used to bolster that claim were that all champions have been in the top 12 of the week 6 AP poll and that "the average Week 6 ranking of the eventual national champion has been 4.7". 

By computing the arthimetic mean on ordinal data, the author fails to compute any metrics to support this claim; I'd like to revise his calcuations to do so as well as more broadly analyze historical weekly polling data against all tournament results to answer a larger question: "Is early season play (mostly non-conference games) undervalued when we pick our brackets?"
